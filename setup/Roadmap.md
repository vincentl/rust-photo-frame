# Setup Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the tasks required to automate the provisioning of a Raspberry Pi for the rust-photo-frame project. Checkboxes are used to indicate completion status.

## Completed in this iteration
- [x] Establish initial `setup/` directory structure and module loader scaffolding.
- [x] Draft initial instructions covering Raspberry Pi imaging, SSH setup, repository cloning, and invoking automation scripts.
- [x] Create base setup modules for OS updates, display boot configuration, Rust installation, and button monitoring prerequisites.

## TODO
- [ ] Document kiosk mode configuration and automation of the rust-photo-frame service.
- [ ] Implement background sync service configuration from cloud storage providers.
- [ ] Add setup module for button monitor service deployment and systemd integration.
- [ ] Add setup module for Wi-Fi connectivity checks and captive portal configuration workflow.
- [ ] Create module for Tailscale installation and registration guidance.
- [ ] Provide lightweight web GUI for local configuration editing with Git-based versioning.
- [ ] Automate configuration-driven restarts of the rust-photo-frame application.
- [ ] Expand testing and validation steps for the full provisioning pipeline.
