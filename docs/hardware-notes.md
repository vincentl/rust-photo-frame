# Hardware Notes

This appendix contains optional accessory guidance and planning details for the Photo Frame build.

For the primary BOM/checklist, use [`hardware.md`](hardware.md).

## Optional accessories

- Active cooling (fan or heatsink) for enclosures with limited airflow.
- Cable sleeves or channels to hide HDMI and power lines.
- VESA mount hardware for flush wall installations.

## Planning tips

- Map power and network access before assembly; pre-routed cables and nearby outlets simplify final installation.
- Reserve GPIO access if you plan to add sensors, status LEDs, or extra buttons later.
- Plan enclosure passthrough points for future wiring so upgrades do not require disassembling the frame.
- Keep thermals in mind early; tightly sealed enclosures need deliberate airflow strategy.
- Keep service access to SD card, power connector, and button wiring for maintenance.
