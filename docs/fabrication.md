# Fabrication

Document the physical build of your frame hereâ€”laser cutting, 3D printing, carpentry, and finishing work. The sections below capture the standard approach; adapt them to match your tools and materials.

## Laser cutting
- Export bezel or mat templates from your CAD tool in SVG or DXF format.
- Test the cut on cardboard to validate fit before committing to acrylic or wood.
- Mask visible surfaces to avoid smoke staining during the cut.

## 3D printing
- Model brackets that clamp the Raspberry Pi to VESA mount points or the display chassis.
- Print test pieces with draft settings to dial in tolerances before switching to final material.
- Add channels or clips for cable routing if you plan to hide wiring behind the frame.

## Carpentry and finishing
- Build a shallow shadow-box to house the monitor. Leave ventilation slots near the top for heat exhaust.
- Use pocket screws or biscuits on long runs so the frame remains rigid after repeated removals from the wall.
- Finish with paint or stain that complements the room lighting; satin sheens minimize glare from the display.

## Assembly checklist
1. Dry-fit the monitor, Pi, brackets, and wiring before final gluing or finishing.
2. Attach French cleats or your preferred wall-mounting hardware.
3. Install the electronics, route cables, and secure strain relief.
4. Close the frame, power it on, and run the software setup steps.
